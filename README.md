# FoodDeliveryDatbaseSolution
A Food Delivery Management System (FDMS) involves various operations at different stages, right from when a customer orders food from a food outlet until the customer's feedback is received. We plan to design a database that would be a platform to order, deliver or pick up food from various restaurants to your doorstep.

FDMS stores information related, but not limited to, customers, restaurants, available food items, orders, payment history, feedback, deliveries, and dispute details. The database will give us insights through reports to have information about sales at a given point of time, onboarded restaurants, delivery/pickup schedules, dispute handling, and provide updates on refunds.
